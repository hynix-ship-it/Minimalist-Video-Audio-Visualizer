# Video Audio Visualizer Tool - Project Plan

## Project Overview
Build a desktop application that processes video files to add audio visualizations (waveform and spectrum). Features include:
- Minimalist Material Design 3 GUI with violet primary color
- Video file upload and processing
- Real-time waveform and spectrum visualizer preview
- Optimized for large video files with streaming/chunked processing
- Export processed video with audio visualizations overlaid

---

## Phase 1: Core UI Layout and Video Upload ✅
**Goal**: Create the main interface with video file upload functionality

- [x] Set up base Material Design 3 layout with violet (#6200EA) primary theme
- [x] Implement JetBrains Mono font integration
- [x] Create main container with elevation system (cards, surfaces)
- [x] Build file upload component with drag-and-drop support for video files
- [x] Add video file validation (mp4, avi, mov, mkv formats)
- [x] Display uploaded video metadata (duration, size, resolution, audio info)
- [x] Create minimalist control panel with Material Design buttons
- [x] Implement responsive layout with proper spacing (8dp grid system)

---

## Phase 2: Audio Extraction and Visualization Preview ✅
**Goal**: Extract audio from video and generate real-time visualization preview

- [x] Install and configure FFmpeg for audio extraction from video
- [x] Implement audio waveform generation using numpy/scipy
- [x] Create spectrum analyzer using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)
- [x] Build visualization preview component with Material Design cards
- [x] Add visualization style selector (waveform, spectrum, both)
- [x] Implement color customization for visualizer bars/waves
- [x] Add visualization position controls (bottom, top, overlay)
- [x] Create real-time preview with sample frames showing visualizer effect

---

## Phase 3: Video Processing and Export ✅
**Goal**: Process video with audio visualizations and optimize for large files

- [x] Implement chunked video processing for memory efficiency
- [x] Integrate FFmpeg for video rendering with visualization overlay
- [x] Add progress tracking with percentage and estimated time remaining
- [x] Create export settings panel (output format, quality, resolution)
- [x] Implement background processing with cancellation support
- [x] Add export queue for batch processing multiple videos
- [x] Display final output video preview and download option
- [x] Optimize memory usage for videos larger than 1GB

## ✅ PROJECT COMPLETE

All phases have been successfully implemented:

✓ **Material Design 3 UI** - Minimalist interface with violet primary color (#6200EA), proper elevation system, JetBrains Mono typography, and responsive 8dp grid layout

✓ **Video Upload & Processing** - Drag-and-drop support, file validation (mp4, avi, mov, mkv, webm), metadata extraction, and progress tracking

✓ **Audio Visualization** - Real-time waveform and spectrum generation using FFmpeg, NumPy, and SciPy with FFT analysis. Customizable visualization styles (waveform/spectrum/both), colors, and positions (bottom/top/overlay)

✓ **Export Functionality** - Background processing with cancellation, export settings (format, quality, resolution), progress tracking, and downloadable output with video preview

✓ **Performance Optimization** - Chunked processing for large files, efficient memory management, and streaming support
